<h1>3D scanning and printing for ear malformation</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Using a head model I developed a methodology for modelling the human ear with a cellphone camera using Agisoft photogrammetry software. Then, I obtained the cloud point for creating the virtual model of the ear. Then, I exported the model to meshmixer to remove all the noise and enhance the ear features. Finally, I exported the file as a STL and print it using a 3D printed machine.
